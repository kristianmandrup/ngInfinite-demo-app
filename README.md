ngInfinite-demo-app
===================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kristianmandrup/ngInfinite-demo-app.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project is an Angular *ngInfiniteScroll* demo app. I am attempting to set up the [Basic demo](http://binarymuse.github.io/ngInfiniteScroll/demo_basic.html)
with Angular-ui router and Karma E2E testing, while learning the basics of Angular development.

Please help out in the effort if you have some experience. I could really use a hand and some extra brain power.
It should be really simple if you understand Angular... I'm just getting started.

Current status: Having trouble getting the Angular-ui state manager working!

### Bootstrap

Switched away from *bootstrap-sass* to *sass-bootstrap*. Still not sure how to configure it properly. It's a jungle!!!

## Help!

I could really use a helping hand with this project. Has any one made the simple Basic demo (or similar) work!?

Any demo projects out there using *nfInfiniteScroll*??

Thanks
